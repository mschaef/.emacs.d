# .emacs.d

My Emacs Configuration

# Notes

After too many years copying `.emacs.d` around various machines, I
decided to resolve the problem once and for all with git. This
repository is the result. It contains a unified configuration I bring
into machines whenever I'm going to use Emacs for any length of
time. 

The general characteristics of my configuration are as follows:

* A visually minimal presentation without toolbars, scrollbars, etc.
* Good support for Java, Clojure, Scheme, C, and JavaScript.
* An ad-hoc personal wiki system I maintain using org-mode.
* Keybindings mostly unchanged from stock Emacs. (I do usually swap Control and Caps-Lock, which is already non-standard enough).
