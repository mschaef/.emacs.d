# .emacs.d
My Emacs Configuration

# Notes

After too many years spent copying .emacs.d files around various machines,
I decided to resolve the problem once and for all using git. This project is 
the configuration I use wherever I use Emacs itself. The general characteristics
of my configuration are as follows:

* A visually minimal presentation without toolbars, scrollbars, etc.
* Good support for Java, Clojure, Scheme, C, and JavaScript.
* An ad-hoc personal wiki system I maintain using org-mode.
* Keybindings mostly unchanged from stock Emacs. (I do usually swap Control and Caps-Lock, which is already non-standard enough).
* Some level of support for Ubuntu Linux, Windows (w/Cygwin), and OSX.
